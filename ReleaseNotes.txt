	<div>
		<h4>Enhancements</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Changed the way Vendor specific settings are performed. A drop down list of all active vendors is now provided rather than specifying a vendor user id. This data is pulled from the store and only active vendors with at least one active product are shown in the list.</li>
			<li>When configuring the settings for a product specific render mode, two drop downs will be used first is the Vendor drop down specified above, second is a product drop down that will automatically pull a list of active products based on the selected vendor. This data is auto populated via the Store API.</li>
			<li>A new render mode "Featured Reviews" was added. This mode will pull recent reviews from the store. Currently, these are 5 star reviews with a good length comment for active products.The goal of this system is to draw attention to quality products that are actively being used and reviewed.</li>
			<li>Another new render mode "Vendor Reviews" was added. This mode will pull all recent reviews form all products by a specific vendor which can be configured in the settings.</li>
			<li>Another new render mode "Package Reviews" was added. This mode will pull all recent reviews for a specific product which can be configured in the settings.</li>
